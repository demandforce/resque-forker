Hell yeah test cases! (Todd Fisher)


2011-02-07 v2.1.0 No arguments necessary for resque-ctl

Added some sane defaults to allow the command to run without command line
arguments. For example, in a rails application development is easy (taf2):

  $ bundle exec resque-ctl


2011-02-02 v2.0 Now, with resque-ctl

You can now run workers from the command line

  $ resque-ctl -c config/resque_workers.rb

or with bundler

  $ bundle exec resque-ctl -c config/resque_workers.rb

Check the README for more details and how to configure.

This awesome feature, brought to you by Todd Fisher (taf2).


2010-09-16 v1.3 Show command in Resque console, USR1 dumps to syslog

Resque console now shows forker script command (look for 'script'). This will
help you determine which version is running, e.g.  .../current/script/worker is
latest, whereas .../releases/20100916/script/worker will get stuck on this
release when you reload.

Experimental: send USR1 single to have Resque::Forker dump Resque statistics,
queue and worker lists to Syslog. You can then enjoy the glory of checking
status from the command line:

  kill -USR1 <pid>
	tail /var/log/syslog.log

2010-09-06 v1.2 Capistrano task and script/trigger

Added Capistrano tasks for pausing, resuming, reloading and listing worker
processes. To use, add this at the top of your Capfile:

  require "resque/capistrano"

And associate your worker instances with the role :worker. The workers will be
reloaded after deploy:restart, suspended before deploy:web:disable and resumed
after deploy:web:enable.

Added script/trigger to queue jobs from the command line (but more likely
cronjob or upstart).

Improved script/worker and /etc/init/workers based on real life experiences.
And real life production deploys, let me tell you, can be a PITA.


2010-08-11 v1.1 Accessible options.

Allows accessing options from forker.
Allows setting verbose and very_verbose options instead of being magically inferred.
Allows passing workload to fork! method as an option.
