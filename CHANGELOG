2010-09-06 v1.2 Capistrano task and script/trigger

Added Capistrano tasks for pausing, resuming, reloading and listing worker
processes. To use, add this at the top of your Capfile:

  require "resque/capistrano"

And associate your worker instances with the role :worker. The workers will be
reloaded after deploy:restart, suspended before deploy:web:disable and resumed
after deploy:web:enable.

Added script/trigger to queue jobs from the command line (but more likely
cronjob or upstart).

Improved script/worker and /etc/init/workers based on real life experiences.
And real life production deploys, let me tell you, can be a PITA.


2010-08-11 v1.1 Accessible options.

Allows accessing options from forker.
Allows setting verbose and very_verbose options instead of being magically inferred.
Allows passing workload to fork! method as an option.
